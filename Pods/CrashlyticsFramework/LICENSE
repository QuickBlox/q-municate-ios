Developer is solely responsible for determining which users will receive an invitation to become a Beta Tester, and for ensuring the accuracy of any user contact information provided to Crashlytics. Developer may provide Beta Testers with its own EULA for a Beta Application that will be accessed by Beta Testers (“Developer EULA”); provided that the Developer EULA provides terms and conditions consistent with the Terms and, with respect to Crashlytics, no less protective than those terms and conditions set forth in the standard EULA provided in Appendix A (“Standard EULA”). If Developer does not provide a separate Developer EULA to Beta Testers that is applicable to Developer’s Beta Application, then Developer acknowledges and agrees that such Beta Testers’ use of the Beta Application shall be subject to the Standard EULA. Developer acknowledges and agrees that Crashlytics provides the Standard EULA by way of convenience only, and does not represent or warrant that the Standard EULA will be enforceable under, or in compliance with, all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or otherwise. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the EULA applicable to Developer’s Beta Application shall be between Developer and any Beta Tester, and Crashlytics shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever for, such EULA, any application tested by a Beta Tester, or for any breach by Developer or any Beta Tester of the terms and conditions of such EULA. The Services allow the Developer to collect information relating to performance of Developer’s applications, including, without limitation, device state information, unique device identifiers, information relating to the physical location of a device, and information about how the application was used. Developer may turn on features of the Services to allow collection of other information via the Services, including some personally identifiable information (e.g., a user’s e-mail address), which allows Developers to communicate with users about the engagement with and functionality of their applications and to invite them to become Beta Testers. Developer represents and warrants that Developer is collecting information via the Services solely to obtain information about the user engagement with and functionality of Developer’s applications, and to communicate with users about such engagement and functionality. Developer agrees that it will not enable collection of personally identifiable information via the Services unless it is necessary to communicate with users about the applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Beta Testers and the user has provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information. Subject to and without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit card information, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, dates of birth or physical addresses via the Services. Developer further agrees it will not enable the collection or use of personally identifiable information by way of applications directed at children under 13 via the Services or provide any personally identifiable information collected via such applications to Crashlytics.

Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” means, with respect to Crashlytics, all financial, business or technical information disclosed by or for Crashlytics in relation to these Terms that is of a nature that should reasonably be considered to be confidential or proprietary. Except for the specific rights granted by these Terms, neither party receiving Confidential Information hereunder (“Recipient”) may use, copy or disclose any Confidential Information of the party disclosing Confidential Information hereunder (“Discloser”) without Discloser’s prior written consent, and shall use no less than reasonable care to safeguard Discloser’s Confidential Information, including ensuring that Recipient’s employees, contractors and agents (“Representatives”) with access to Discloser’s Confidential Information have a need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of these Terms and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective of the parties as those set forth herein.

Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its Representatives, as applicable. Promptly upon Discloser’s request at any time, Recipient shall return all of Discloser’s tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records, copies, summaries, analyses and materials developed therefrom. Nothing herein shall prevent a party from disclosing any of the other’s Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court order or any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation; provided, however, prior to any such disclosure, Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify Discloser in writing of such requirement to disclose, and (b) cooperate with Discloser in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order.

For the sake of clarity, Results shall expressly exclude all Background Materials. Developer shall own all right, title and interest (including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights) in and to feedback, suggestions, ideas or other materials and information provided by Beta Testers with respect to any Beta Application (“User Feedback”), the Results and Developer Data. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the Results will be presented to it in a Report, the Report Format of which is Confidential Information and proprietary to Crashlytics. Developer may make a reasonable number of copies of the Reports only for its internal purposes in using the Results. Developer hereby grants to Crashlytics a license-fee free, royalty-free, fully paid up, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable, worldwide right and license to (a) use the Developer Data, Performance Data and User Feedback, solely for purposes of providing the Services to Developer, (b) use the Developer Data, Performance Data and User Feedback to create aggregate measures of Services usage, engagement, and performance, and (c) use the Results and aggregated Developer Data, Performance Data and User Feedback to improve the Services generally and for its other business purposes.
